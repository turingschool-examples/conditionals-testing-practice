# Conditionals Practice

## Set up:
1. `clone` down the repo
2. `cd` into the repo's root directory
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm test` to run tests

There are multiple test files available for practice. 
- The sweater-test file and Sweater.js involve a Class, so you can get practice writing a conditional in a class method. 
- The general-test and general.js do not involve a class, so you can practice conditionals by themselves.
